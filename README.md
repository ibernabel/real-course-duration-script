### Code snippet to know the actual course duration of Platzi's course.

##### Warning: You must have an active account and have access to view all classes in the course in order to use this tool.
- This code snippet reads the Platzi's course presentation page, searches the information about the duration of each video class and calculates the real duration of the course.
- You can paste the code on your DevTools console and run them. (Before you might need to allow permission for this writing, "allow pasting" in the console before running this. Ensure you have read the code before doing it and understand how it works)
Then, the result of actual and precise course duration will print in the console. Hours, minutes and seconds.
- Furthermore, you can also add this code snippet as a new file in the "source" section on the chrome devs tools and run this.
- I prefer use the Chrome web Extension: [Custom JavaScript for Websites 2]([https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk?pli=1])
You must follow the instruction of the extension about how it works.
